            <p>For our Independent Project, we (Amanda and Kylie) are proposing to create a high fidelity prototype of a previous project from a past SMAD class. In SMAD 317, we designed an app called, Dukes Drivers, where we gathered information from the JMU Sober Rides Facebook page and organized it into its own app. The Facebook page is very disorganized and hard to find what you are looking for so this way our app was a central place to go to for everything a JMU student would need to get a safe ride home when under the influence.  Two of our goals for this project include. Our audience has always been geared towards any JMU student and we feel that it will remain that way as we create the high fidelity prototype for the app. Our timeline will follow a simple schedule to lead us in the right direction of completing this project on time. The week after we submit this independent project proposal, we are going to work on creating sketches and developing storyboards. During this week, we are also going to start brainstorming our technical goals that we want to accomplish. During week 5, we are going to submit the independent project certificate as well as the screen cast that goes with it. While there is nothing to officially turn in on week 6, we are going to work to finalize the production of the app. In week 7, that is when we are going to submit the final deliverables and the official summary of everything that we worked on.
