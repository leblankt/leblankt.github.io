                For my independent project, I am working together with Amanda Nord to create a high fidelity prototype of our app, Duke Drivers, that we established in SMAD 317. This app was created to have a more organizational and centralized location to offer sober rides for JMU students only.My first goal for this project is to increase the usability of the app. My objective is to add features such as voice recognition, which makes the app more easy to use for users. My second goal is to make more cohesive branding throughout the app. My objective for this is to establish a standardized font, style, and color pallet throughout the app that reflects the vision, personality, and goals of Duke Drivers.
                Our audience has always been geared towards any JMU student and I feel that it will remain that way as we create the high fidelity prototype for the app. Our timeline will follow a simple schedule to lead us in the right direction of completing this project on time. The week after we submit this independent project proposal, we are going to work on creating sketches and developing storyboards. During this week, we are also going to start brainstorming our technical goals that we want to accomplish. During week 5, we are going to submit the independent project certificate as well as the screen cast that goes with it. While there is nothing to officially turn in on week 6, we are going to work to finalize the production of the app. In week 7, that is when we are going to submit the final deliverables and the official summary of everything that we worked on.
